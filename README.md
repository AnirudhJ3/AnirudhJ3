**Welcome to the Matrix**

**About Me**  

I'm an AI & Robotics researcher focused on **building digital twins to advance Physical AI**. My current work involves creating high-fidelity digital-twins of real-world environments using **radiance field rendering, 3D computer vision, and robotics simulation**. As a robotics graduate researcher, I develop **Perception and SLAM algorithms** for autonomous systems.

### What I Work On:  
🤖 **Digital Twins & Robotics Simulation** – Using **Gaussian Splatting** and **3D vision** to create realistic virtual environments. 
⚡ **Robotics Software & Algorithms** – Developing **stereo visual odometry, SLAM, and perception systems** for autonomous robots.  
🔬 **High-Performance AI** – GPU-accelerated deep learning, real-time inference, and scalable AI architectures.  

### Notable Projects:  
- **Warehouse Robot Navigation & Simulation** – Training AI agents for autonomous warehouse operations using MuJoCo.
- **Warehouse AMR Navigation** – Working on **warehouse robot navigation and simulation in MuJoCo** using **RL and Model Predictive Control**.  
- **AI-Driven Security Log Analysis** – Scalable anomaly detection using Kafka, GCP, and FastAPI.  
- **WaiterAI** – Voice assistant with **Whisper & RAG**, optimized for real-time interactions.  

### Tech Stack:  
🦾 **Robotics & Vision** – ROS, MuJoCo, OpenCV, Radiance Fields  
💡 **AI/ML** – PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, ONNX  
🖥️ **Infra & MLOps** – GCP, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka
